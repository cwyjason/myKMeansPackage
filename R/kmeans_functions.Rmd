## R Packages and Shiny (Part 2-3)

### Part 2: Creating the K-means R Package

For this assignment, I created a comprehensive R package for K-means clustering called `myKMeansPackage`. The package includes two main functions:

1. `kmeans_cluster()` - Performs K-means clustering on a dataset with proper input validation
2. `kmeans_plot()` - Visualizes the clustering results with customizable options

Both functions are thoroughly documented with roxygen comments and include detailed examples. The package also includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and correct error handling.

Here's an example of using the functions:

```r
library(myKMeansPackage)

# Generate sample data
set.seed(123)
data <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 2)

# Perform clustering
result <- kmeans_cluster(data, centers = 3)

# Plot the results
kmeans_plot(data, result)
```

The Shiny app is included in the package's `inst/shiny_app` directory and can be launched with:

```r
shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny_app", package = "myKMeansPackage"))
```

The Shiny app provides a user-friendly interface for exploring K-means clustering with:

- Multiple data generation options (normal clusters, uniform random, circular pattern, or the iris dataset)
- Controls for the number of clusters and other K-means parameters
- Interactive visualization of clustering results
- Display of clustering statistics

### Part 3: GitHub Repository

My K-means package is available on GitHub at: [https://github.com/cwyjason/myKMeansPackage](https://github.com/cwyjason/myKMeansPackage)

The repository includes:
- Full source code for the package
- Documentation generated with roxygen2
- Unit tests created with testthat
- A comprehensive README file
- The Shiny app in the inst/shiny_app directory
